### ETL â€“ Data Pipeline 
You need to keep data synchronized between different databases/data warehouses as a part of your daily routine. One task that is routinely performed is the sync up of the transactional database and staging data warehouse. Automating this sync-up will save you time and standardize your process.
Create a shell script to 


Extract the data using increamental load from the MySQL database to extract data added in the last 4 hours and then load it into the PostgreSQL Staging warehouse 

Transform the data into staging database and create DimDate

Transform the data into staging database and create  FactSales table

![Screenshot: ](img/3-2.png )

Export the tables as CSV files for loading into the production warehouse.
